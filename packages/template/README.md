## To Download VS Code:

Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/download and download applicable version for your machine

## Configuring Settings in VS Code:

There are two types of settings VS Code provides - User (these apply globally to any instance of VS Code you open) and Workspace (these settings are stored inside your workspace in a .vscode folder and will only be applied when the workspace is opened)

To configure the desired settings go to File > Preferences > Settings (Code > Preferences > Settings on a Mac) for both user and workspace settings. Your changes will go into effect after the settings.json file has been saved.

In Windows the Settings File is located at %APPDATA%\Code\User\settings.json

On a Mac the Settings File is located at $HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json

In Linux the Settings File is at $HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json

For the workspace settings file, go to the .vscode folder within your project

## To Get Extensions in VS Code:

- Step 1. Bring up the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon (a square icon usually at the bottom of the icon list) in the Activity Bar on the side of the VS Code platform or use the command (Ctrl + Shift + X)

- Step 2. Browse the various extensions until you find the one you want. In order to see a more in-depth explanation of any extension simply click on its name to open a side view which will give you the details, contributions, changelog, and dependencies of the chosen extension. When you've found what you want click the Install button next to the chosen extension.

- Step 3. In order for your downloaded extensions to take effect in VS Code click the Reload button that appears after the extension is successfully downloaded. This will restart VS Code and allow your extension to be used.

## To Manage Extensions in VS Code:

#### To List Installed Extensions:

Open the More Actions (…) drop-down menu and select 'Show Installed Extensions'. This will show you all installed extensions.

#### To Uninstall an Extension:

Click the gear button on the right of an extension entry and choose Uninstall from the drop-down menu. Then reload VS Code when prompted to uninstall the extension on your machine.

#### To Disable an Extension:

Click the gear button on the right of an extension entry and choose Disable or Disable (Workspace) {this will only disable the extension for your current workspace}. Then reload VS Code when prompted to disable the extension.

#### To Enable an Extension:

Click the gear button on the right of an extension entry and choose Enable or Enable (Workspace). Then reload VS Code when prompted to enable the extension.

#### To Automatically Update Extensions:

VS Code checks for updates on extensions and automatically installs them. You'll know an extension has been updated if you are prompted to reload VS Code.

#### To Update Extensions Manually:

If auto-update of extensions is disabled (accomplished by setting extensions.autoUpdate to false). Open the More Actions (…) drop-down menu and select 'Show Outdated Extensions' then click the Update button on the extensions you'd like to update. You will then be prompted to reload VS Code so the update can go into effect.

## To Download Node:

Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download and download applicable version for your machine and project

## To Get Existing NPM Scripts to Interact With Current Libraries:

To run any script (created in the package.json of your project and will look like:

"scripts:" {
"script_name" : "file_you_want_script_to_run",
"script_name" : "file_you_want_script_to_run",
"script_name" : "file_you_want_script_to_run"
}

) simply run 'npm run script_name' in the terminal.

## Workflow

The only system dependency of this project is nodejs. This project is OS and IDE agnostic, though I recommend a modern text editor. @DuncanWalter uses and recommends `VSCode` (not to be confused with `Visual Studio`).

Assert that you have `node` installed. Open the project directory in a terminal or command prompt. The first time you open the project and anytime the project's dependencies change, you'll need to run:

```bash
npm install
```

This fetches all the project dependencies and lobs thim into the `node_modules` directory. Note that `package-lock.json` is autogenerated and exists to keep our dependencies in sync, so you shouldn't have to run `npm install` often.

Use the following commands (specified in `package.json#scripts`) to interact with and the project.

```bash
# Run Jest tests:
npm run test

# Run dev mode serve:
# Recompiles on save,
# Automatically opens in browser.
npm run dev

# Run prod mode build:
# Compile with minification,
# compression, and prod sources.
npm run build
```

You should be able to configure your work environment to autoformat files on save using the `prettier` configuration found in `package.json` (using the `prettier` extension in `VSCode`, for example). @DuncanWalter would also like to add linting support.

All git commits are guarded by a `husky` precommit check which runs tests and makes sure `prettier` has run over all the files.

## Contributing

- Never work on the `master` branch
- use feature based, kebab-cased names for branches
- Never merge a pull request without review and approval
- Review others' code
- Use 'squash and merge' when merging pull requests
- Prefer `git rebase` over `git merge`
- When making pull requests with UI changes, include screenshots

## Under the Hood

- `React`: Most popular UI library/framework in the world, and for good reason.
- `Rollup`: javascript bundler which, as of Feb. 2018, `Rollup` supports the code splitting and dynamic imports we need to do our jobs correctly.
- `Jest`: Test runner that just works. UI can be difficult to test, but `Jest` will be invaluable if we add `redux` or other abstractions.
- `Typescript`: language pragma which adds type declarations to javascript. It has a structural, algebraic type system.
